#Hacks
Students need to demonstrate all these tools running to Scrum Team and then the Teacher. Issues need to be worked out quickly. Before asking Teacher ask 3 other students. Do not delay in Tool Setup task, there will be no late makeup for points!!! Tool and Equipment setup is like attendance, without Tools and Equipment you are effectually absent.

##Part 1 - FastpagesProvide a comment on this page to show Fastpages/GH Pages Web Server and Tool success
Hint. Make a simple comment “Working on it”. This can be edited by clicking on Time Stamp of post; at this point you will see triple dots (…); clicking dots provides an Edit option; clicking Edit takes you to a friendly “Markdown editor”. Enjoy this editor, my suggestion is build your entire message in thi editor and/or build personal message in Fastpages / GitHub pages “_post” and share the following.
Share link to personal Fastpages / GitHub pages running on github.io. My suggestion is to change index.html to show it is really yours.
Share link to a new page (_posts) in your Fastpages project show use of Markdown and/or HTML fragments. You will need to learn special date requirements of a file as well as a little Markdown or HTML.
Share link to Python Jupyter notebook (_notebooks) showing usage of Python: print (“Hello”)
Share link to Java Jupyter notebook (_notebooks) showing usage of Java: System.out.println(“Hello”)
Capture image/screen capture of Fastpages project showing use of an Integrated Development Environment (VS Studio)
Share link showing your GitHub insights. This is your personal activity of commit history.
##Part 2 - Java Project - Screen Capture Java project running on personal laptop localhost:0.0.0.0:8080 - Share link of GitHub code commit Java on project
